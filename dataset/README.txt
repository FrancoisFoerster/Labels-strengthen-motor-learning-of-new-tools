These scripts and datasets correspond to the behavioural data of the study "Labels strengthen motor learning of new tools".

Participants learnt how to manipulate novel tools either associated with a name (ie. a label).

Results show that adding a label to a novel tool reinforces the learning of the tool use throughout practice (SuccessTask script).

Moreover, the label influence the participants' ability to move or use the tool (ReactionTimes script).
